        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>This project addresses the escalating cybersecurity challenges in Internet of Things (IoT) architectures by presenting a unified framework that integrates standard guidelines from OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) and NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). By considering specific attributes provided by the user, such as components, devices, connectivity, and network details, the system dynamically generates tailored cybersecurity guidelines. This approach involves a user-friendly interface, an intelligent algorithm mapping attributes to OWASP and NIST standards, and a comprehensive output highlighting recommended security measures. Focused on empowering users to fortify their IoT architectures against emerging cyber threats, the project merges the expertise encapsulated in OWASP and NIST, contributing to cybersecurity practices in the evolving IoT landscape. Additionally, a React component named the Recommendation System, integrated into a broader application, enhances the implementation of security recommendations across diverse technological domains like Machine Learning (ML), Web/Mobile, Cloud, and IoT. This component utilizes React state management, event handling, and conditional rendering for an interactive and user-centric interface. In a related module, the project addresses the pervasive threat of Data Poisoning in ML, Web Apps, IoT, and Cloud computing. The Security Recommendation System for Data Poisoning Prevention offers developers tools to combat this threat effectively, providing real-time, tailored security recommendations based on a comprehensive knowledge base of data poisoning attack vectors and mitigation strategies. By minimizing data poisoning vulnerabilities, the project contributes to creating safer and more reliable ecosystems for ML, web applications, IoT, and Cloud deployments, ultimately fostering trust and integrity in these transformative technologies.</p>
