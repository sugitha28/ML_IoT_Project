        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This module is tailored to provide comprehensive security recommendations, general mitigations, and insights into potential attacks across diverse technological domains, including Machine Learning (ML), Web/Mobile, Cloud, and Internet of Things (IoT). It focuses on offering users an interactive and user-centric interface to access pertinent security recommendations relevant to their specific technological contexts. The system's design prioritizes formality and polish, ensuring a robust implementation of the security recommendation system without delving into specific code details. By utilizing React state management, event handling, and conditional rendering, the application enhances the user experience, fostering a proactive and informed approach to security measures across various technological landscapes.

        <h2>Working Principle</h2>
         <!-- Example of a flowchart image -->
        <p>
            This overview outlines common application security vulnerabilities, categorizing them into two main groups: attacks on the application itself and attacks on the application's infrastructure. Application-level attacks include injection, denial-of-service, brute-force, man-in-the-middle, insecure direct object references, and insecure deserialization. Infrastructure-level attacks encompass those on the operating system, network, and physical infrastructure. The accompanying flowchart serves as a visual aid, aiding in the understanding of these vulnerabilities and their potential exploitation. This resource is invaluable for security professionals, providing a systematic approach to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in applications, ultimately enhancing overall security measures.

        <p>
            The flowchart delineates potential security risks inherent in deploying a cloud environment. Initiating with the creation of the cloud infrastructure, the outlined risks include unauthorized access, facilitated by hacking, phishing, or malware, leading to data theft or denial-of-service attacks. Insecure APIs pose a threat if not properly secured, enabling attackers to exploit communication channels. Weak access controls amplify the risk of unauthorized users gaining access to sensitive data. Insider threats emerge from within the organization, with employees or trusted partners misusing their access. Insecure configurations render the cloud environment susceptible to attacks due to complexity. Data breaches, DDoS attacks, and malware/ransomware infections are highlighted as prominent risks, emphasizing the necessity for robust security measures in cloud environments. This comprehensive overview serves as a guide for understanding and addressing potential security challenges in cloud deployment.
